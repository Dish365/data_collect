REFINED PROJECT INSTRUCTIONS - DATA COLLECTION SYSTEM

========================================================================

1. ADD INSTITUTION FIELD TO USER SIGNUP
========================================================================
- Extend the user registration process to include an "Institution" field
- This should be a required text field during signup (in both backend authentication models and frontend signup screen)
- Institution should be stored in the user profile and displayed in user management interfaces
- Consider whether institution should be searchable/filterable for administrative purposes

2. IMPLEMENT RESPONDENTID SYSTEM
========================================================================
- Create a RespondentID field to track who is providing each response
- This should be separate from the user who created the form/project
- RespondentID should be automatically generated or manually assigned when someone begins answering a form
- Link responses to specific respondents to enable tracking of individual participant data
- Consider privacy implications and whether RespondentID should be anonymized

3. CHANGE QUESTION TYPE TO RESPONSE TYPE
========================================================================
- Refactor the current "question_type" field to be "response_type" 
- This better reflects that it describes the type of response expected (text, multiple choice, rating scale, etc.) rather than categorizing the question itself
- Update all related database fields, API endpoints, and frontend components
- Ensure backward compatibility or plan data migration strategy

4. ADD LOCATION FIELDS TO PROJECTS
========================================================================
- Extend the Project model to include location/site information
- Add fields for:
  - Site name/identifier
  - Geographic location (country, region, city)
  - Coordinates (if needed for mapping)
  - Site description/notes
- Make location data available in project listings and analytics
- Consider whether location should be hierarchical (country > region > site)

5. RESTRUCTURE RESPONSE DATA MODEL
========================================================================
- Move current response content to a new "responseID" field structure
- This suggests creating a proper Response record with unique identifiers
- Each response should have:
  - Unique ResponseID
  - Link to RespondentID  
  - Link to specific Question
  - Response content/value
  - Timestamp and metadata
- This enables better tracking and analytics of individual responses vs. bulk response data

IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY
========================================================================
1. Database model changes (Response restructuring, RespondentID)
2. Authentication updates (Institution field)
3. API endpoint modifications
4. Frontend form and display updates
5. Data migration scripts (if needed)
